# Starbucks Offers Analysis

# Introduction
Marketing and data science can make an amazing results in company Advertising campaigns, this project take Starbucks data to improve their offers.


In this project, I tried to analyze Starbuck dataset and make a model to predict the customers 'event' when have an offer whether they will receive it, view it, make a transaction or complete it.

First I explored the data and see what I have to change before start the analysis.

Then I did some exploratory analysis on the data.

## Problem Statement

We'll work on the Starbucks's Dataset, which mimics how consumers make purchasing decisions and how promotional offers influence those decisions.

Buy-one-get-one (BOGO), discount, and informational offers are the three sorts of offers that can be sent.

We'll split client data based on several criteria and examine their behavior in response to various offers.

#### In the Data Analysis section of this project, we'll examine the data and try to answer the following questions:
- What is the age ranges for Starbucks customer?
- Is the subscription program useful and used by customers?
- What is the gender distribution for Starbucks customers?
- What is the relationship between the customer attributes?
- What age group affects Starbucks can income?
- What is the age and gender distribution in Starbucks customers?
- What is the average age of Starbucks customers?
- What is the average income of Starbucks customers?
- What is the number of Starbucks customers over the year?
- What is the preferred offer type for Starbucks customers?
- What is the offer event and gender distribution in Starbucks customers?
